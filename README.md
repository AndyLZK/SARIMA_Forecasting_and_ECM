# Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) Forecasting and Error Correction Model 

In this notebook, we will explore the theoretical foundations and mathematical intuition behind time series models with real-world applications to Singapore's 1975 Q1 to 2024 Q4 Quarterly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Consumption data.

The analysis is divided into two main sections:

## Section 1: Time Series Forecasting on Singapore's GDP 
  - 1.1 Time Series Assumptions
  - 1.2 Exploratory Data Analysis on GDP
  - 1.3 Highly Persistent and Trending Time Series
  - 1.4 Differencing and Order of Integration
  - 1.5 Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)
  - 1.6 Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)
  - 1.7 Out-of-Sample Forecasting

## Section 2: Error Correction Model

  - 2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis on Consumption
  - 2.2 Time Series Analysis on Consumption
  - 2.3 Testing for Cointegration
  - 2.4 Derivation and Explanation of Error Correction Model
  - 2.5 Engle-Granger Two-Step Procedure
  - 2.6 Out-of-Sample Forecasting for Error Correction Model
